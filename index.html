        <h2>üìú Oh, hi there!</h2>
        <p>
          So this website is mostly a mockup so I could have some vertical
          scrolling to bind the position of the 3D camera to the screen
          position. I'm not passionate about lorem ipsum so I will just throw
          some facts about myself.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm a web developer junior who happens to love a lot of things, before
          that I was a digital printing and prepress technician. I always loved
          art. Since I was a kid I spent tons of hours reading graphic novels,
          watching animation and drawing.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also love music, I bullied my parents with my recorder since I was
          six. When I turned sixteen I get myself an electric guitar to keep my
          parents away of the cold embrace of silence. With the years I keep
          collecting music instruments, mostly from the woodwind family.

              This one! I'm happy to show you this particular project. I'm
              learning to model and render 3D scenes inside webpages, as I would
              love to make a 3D portfolio that looks nice and steps out from the
              other ones!

              It's a flight search enginge that takes two IATA codes and shows

        <p>
          I've got a couple of projects more but maybe they are a work in
          progress, not as interesting as the ones above or I just didn't feel
          like deploying them. If you are interested in them check my

        <h2>üåÆ Random trivia</h2>

        <h3>VideoGames and their consequences</h3>
        <p>
          I love videogames, I've been playing them nonstop since I was six. I
          raised playing The legend of Zelda, Pokemon, Tekken3 and Tony Hawk pro
          skater 2. As I grew my taste grew too, tried some JRPG like golden sun
          or Fire emblem, the father of search action games metroid and another
          tons of titles.
        </p>
        <h3>Skateboard Music and much more!</h3>
        <p>
          One of the multiple games I played as a kid was Tony Hawk pro skater 1
          and 2. A combination of that and the fact that I lived near a
          skatepark got me into skateboarding. From my twelves until my early
          twenties I practiced skate on a daily basis. That was not the only
          thing videogames influenced in me. I got my musical taste from the
          Tony Hawk's OST and Guitar Hero 3 and as a matter of fact I discovered
          my passion for programming playing minecraft.
        </p>
        <h3>Art</h3>
        <p>
          As I said before, I always loved drawing, reading graphic novels and
          watching animation movies. I've never considered myself an artist,
          because it was not my main goal in life. But I came across this
          question once and I didn't know what to say.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's hard to tell because sometimes I design pictures like: Posters,
          informative sheets or logos. I like drawing and now I'm even learning
          to make 3D models. Sometimes I also feel that programming could be a
          way to express myself, and it's not art all about that?
